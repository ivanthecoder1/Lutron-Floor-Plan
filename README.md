# Capstone: Lutron Floor Plan

A multi-collaborative application where users can upload floor plans (ceiling plans) and annotate it with other users in real-time using stamps / icons (representing sensors, shades, light fixtures, etc). 

### **Tech Stack:** 
- Front-End: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- Back-End: Firebase, Socket.IO, Express
- Testing: Cypress, Jest
- Libraries: Fabric.js, react-pdf

## Features
- Users can upload, delete, rename, and share floorplans
- User can use drawing tools to annotate a floorplan with devices and controls to create a system layout.
- Multi-user experience wherein any updates made to the floorplan is instantly visible on all usersâ€™ floorplans (i.e., the state of the floorplan is synchronized across all users currently looking at it).
- User can export an annotated floorplan
- Unit & integration tested using modern web project best practices (e.g., Jest, Cypress, etc.)
